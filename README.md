Problem Statement : 
  Detection of suicidal ideation of an individual using audio-visual cues .
Approach:
  Utilize audio-visual cues for suicidal ideation detection: 1. Ethically gather diverse data. 2. Extract relevant features from audio and visual inputs. 3. Preprocess and 
  normalize features. 4. Develop models using fusion techniques and deep learning algorithms. 5. Evaluate, refine iteratively, and deploy responsibly in crisis intervention 
  platforms.
Tech Stack:
   Back End- Python
   Front End - HTML, CSS, javascript
Basic Workflow:
    Utilizing audio-visual cues for detecting suicidal ideation entails several crucial steps. Firstly, assemble a diverse dataset encompassing both control subjects and           individuals exhibiting suicidal tendencies, ensuring ethical sourcing and annotation by mental health professionals. Extract relevant features from both audio and visual       modalities, including pitch, intensity, speech rate, and facial expressions. Preprocess and normalize these features to eliminate noise and extraneous data. In model 
    development, employ multimodal fusion techniques like intermediate, late, or early fusion to combine audio and visual features. Utilize machine learning or deep learning 
    algorithms such as RNNs, CNNs, Random Forest, or SVMs, along with transfer learning from pre-trained models like BERT or ResNet. Incorporate attention mechanisms to focus 
    on informative segments. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, ensuring robustness via cross-validation. Continuously refine the model based 
    on expert input and new data, while deploying it responsibly to address ethical considerations like privacy and bias reduction. Finally, integrate the trained model into 
    existing crisis intervention or mental health support platforms, monitoring and updating its performance regularly to maintain effectiveness.
